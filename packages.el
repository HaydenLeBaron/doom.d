;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here, run 'doom sync' on
;; the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect.
;; Alternatively, use M-x doom/reload.


;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;(unpin! pinned-package)
;; ...or multiple packages
;(unpin! pinned-package another-pinned-package)
;; ...Or *all* packages (NOT RECOMMENDED; will likely break things)
;(unpin! t)


;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

(package! org-brain)  ; Wiki/mind-map combo
(package! company-jedi)  ; Python auto-completion
(package! elpy)  ; The "emacs python IDE"
(package! function-args) ; Better cpp function args autocomplete (not in minibuffer)
                         ; TODO: consider removing if unnecessary.
                         ; TODO: note: lsp-ui might make this unnecessary
(package! lsp-ui) ; Allows for in-window docs info (connects to lsp server)
;;(package! clang-format) ; Code-prettification tool (THIS WAS BREAKING THINGS)


;; To install a package directly from a particular repo, you'll need to specify
;; a `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, for whatever reason,
;; you can do so here with the `:disable' property:
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))
